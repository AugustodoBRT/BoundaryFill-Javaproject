Boundary Fill Simulation in Java  

A simple Java project using AWT and Swing to demonstrate the Boundary Fill Algorithm with an interactive grid.  

Features  
- Interactive Filling: Click on any white cell to fill connected cells.  
- Randomized Grid: Generates a random 15x15 grid of black (boundaries) and white cells.  
- Animated Fill: Visual filling process with smooth animation.
